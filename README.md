# MERN Starter App

A seed starter app using Node (Express) and React (server side rendering) created to be used as the base for future projects and whatnot. So far successfully used to create my blog Im So Code (https://github.com/jeanbeanie/imsocode-blog-2)

Webpack/Babel (with hot reloading) is set up for development. Ava is included for test running.

### Create your config file (see src/config.example.js), then just add water
> ```npm install```

##### Compile code and start server in production
> ```npm start``` 

##### ...or run server for development with hot reload enabled
> ```npm run start:dev``` 

##### Run all tests
> ```npm test```

##### ...or watch your tests as you write code
> ```npm watch```
### Have fun!
